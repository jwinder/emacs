# My Emacs Configuration

I use the emacs setup from [rubbish](https://github.com/rubbish/rubbish-emacs-setup) as a basis. I've added a few of my own opinionated things over the past couple years.

This configuration has been used for both Ubuntu & OSX. It __should__ work fairly well right away.

# Install Emacs

With Homebrew:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb

With Apt:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install emacs24

# Using This Config

Clone this repo:

    git clone git@github.com:jwinder/emacs.d.git $HOME/.emacs.d

Then Run Emacs.
